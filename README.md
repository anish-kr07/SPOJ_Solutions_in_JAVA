# SPOJ_Soulutions_inJAVA
This is a dedicated Repo for SPOJ problems' solutions in jAVA

Some selected solutions

To see problem, put http://www.spoj.com/problems/FILENAME/ Make sure it's all caps, and don't include the .java extension
I would strongly suggest to try the problem on your own,and check for the solutions only whem you are completely confused.

To run the program directly on SPOJ server, CHange the Classname to <Main>
  EX :
      Class TEST  => Class Main
